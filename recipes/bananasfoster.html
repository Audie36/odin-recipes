            Except for the folks that burn their houses down, everybody loves this recipe.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 bananas, peeled and halved lengthwise and crosswise</li>
            <li>2 fluid ounces rum</li>
            <li>1 fluid ounce banana liqueur</li>
            <li>2 pinches ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 scoops vanilla ice cream</li>
            <li>2 small sprigs of mint</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat butter and brown sugar in a skillet over medium-high heat until butter melts and mixture begins to bubble, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place bananas, cut-side down, into the brown sugar mixture. Cook until just golden, about 30 seconds; flip and cook until golden on the other side, about 30 seconds. Turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>With the heat off, pour rum and banana liqueur into the skillet. Turn the heat to medium-high or high; cook until alcohol ignites and flames, 1 to 3 minutes. Carefully add cinnamon. When the flames die, remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Scoop vanilla ice cream into two bowls. Divide banana mixture between the bowls and garnish with mint sprigs.</li>
        </ol>
